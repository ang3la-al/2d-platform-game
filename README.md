This project is a 2D platform game I coded during my A level Computer Science course. It is coded in Python using the Pygame library.
Game.py is the main file to be executed.

- Used the Pygame library for developing interactive 2D games in Python.
- Created dynamic game levels with different terrain, collectibles, enemies, and player interactions.
- Implemented collision detection algorithms for enemy and environment interactions.
- Designed reusable game components using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Used iterative testing and debugging techniques to ensure game functionality and stability.
- Integrated sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Developed transition screens and level selection menus for smooth navigation between levels.
